# Altium Designer/Circuit Maker Pcb Library
## Summary:
* First of all, I have to say thank you [Mark](https://github.com/issus) because of your "exceptional, open source database library for Altium" and honestly, this library is based on his project [altium-library](https://github.com/issus/altium-library), so why I am going to invent the wheel again?! Actually, the problem with Mark's project is that, the library not only is too slow ( maybe because of its online query from the database or any other reason(s)), but also, nobody can add any new component(s) to it, because it is based on Microsoft Azure Database and no one has direct access to it except Mark, I think. Besides, the library has not been updated for a long time and all pull requests are waiting for a long time, however, I have to say again, thank you.    
## Features:
* More than 29,000 electronic components
* More than 600 footprints
* Easy to use and portable Integrated Library
* High quality 3D models
* Digikey Part number
